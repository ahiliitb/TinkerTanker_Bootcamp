# Tinkercademy Bootcamp (June 2024)

Welcome to the bootcamp! Use this repository to store and collaborate on code across your team! 

Note that you should work on a different branch, complete your work and create a pull request to merge your changes instead of commiting directly to `main`/`master`. Also note that at least 1 approver is needed before the pull request can be merged.
